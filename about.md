## EXPERIENCE

#### Intern at **enioka Haute Couture** <span style="float: right; ">Sept. 2019-Dec. 2019</span>
During my internship at [enioka Haute Couture](https://haute-couture.enioka.com/), I was the sole intern working on [ComDaAn](https://framagit.org/ervin/ComDaAn).
[ComDaAn](https://framagit.org/ervin/ComDaAn) previously used git repositories to visualize the corresponding community's activity, size, network and member centrality.

My work* consisted of **adding mailing lists and GitLab issues as additional data sources** and the option for an issue response analysis.
I also worked on **multiprocessing** the time consuming operations and on **integrating LOWESS regressions** for the curves in the project.
Finally, I **reworked the code to follow an OOP logic**, **renovated the project's API** to better suit the needs of its target users and added a **test suite**.

Being the only intern working on the project, I benefited from a **fair amount of autonomy** regarding project management and decision making.

Technologies used: Python (pandas, numpy, networkx, bokeh, etc.)

*More information on my work on the project can be found in my blog post: [Tooling For Community Data Analytics](http://chzn.fr/blog/tooling-for-community-data-analytics) which is about the state of the project after my changes.

## EDUCATION

#### EPITA <span style="float: right; ">Sept. 2018- July 2021</span>
**Diplôme d’ingénieur**  
[EPITA](https://www.epita.fr/) or  École Pour l'Informatique et les Techniques Avancées is a french computer engineering school. I joined it in 2018 and am **set to graduate in 2021**.
I'm an **active member in multiple associations** that promote acceptance, openness and multiculturalism.


#### ESIB <span style="float: right; ">Sept. 2015- July 2018</span>
**Bac+3**
[ESIB](https://esib.usj.edu.lb/) or École Supérieur des Ingénieurs de Beyrouth is an engineering school in Lebanon. I joined it in 2015 for my **"classes préparatoires"** which are mandatory pre-engineering classes in the french system that span over two years. I have also done **a year of computer engineering** in ESIB before deciding to move to France and tranfer to EPITA.  


#### Soeurs des Saints-Coeurs Sioufi  <span style="float: right; ">Sept. 2000-June 2015</span>
**From kindergarten to High School**
Soeurs des Saints-Coeurs Siouf or SSCC Sioufi for short is a french school in Lebanon. It is where I've gotten my primary, complementary and secondary education.
I've completed a **Baccalauréat Scientifique** with a specialty in mathematics, and got a **Mention Bien** at the official exams.

## PROJECTS
#### ComDaAn - Data Analytics <span style="float: right; ">Sept. 2019-Dec. 2019</span>  
[ComDaAn](https://framagit.org/ervin/ComDaAn) is a suite of tools for analyzing the data produced by FOSS communities. It relies mainly on the pandas, numpy, networkx and bokeh libraries.


#### **Spell Checker**  <span style="float: right; ">2020</span>
For a Text Mining and Natural Language class, we implemented, in a group of three, a spell checker **based on a Trie** data structure and using the **Damerau–Levenshtein distance**.
The search for the results had to happen under **time and memory constraints** which meant memory mapping and management had to be handled deftly.

Technologies: C++, Python for validation testing, Memory profiling tools, etc.


#### Azure ChatBot <span style="float: right; ">2020</span>
Using the various **Congnitive Services on Azure**, in a group of 5 we built a **conversational chatbot** with built-in **Speech-to-Text** and **Text-to-Speech** features.
It used the NASA FAQs to build a knowledge base to answer questions about space and the climate.
When the bot couldn't find an answer to a question asked in its knowledge base, it would search for it on the internet.

Tools: The Azure cloud platform with a focus on Azure Cognitive Services (QnAMaker, Azure Bot Service, Azure Speech Service, Azure Search, etc.)


### TC - Tiger Compiler <span style="float: right; ">2019</span>  
TC is a project done in a group of 4 students.
It is a **full front end compiler** with a **lexical, syntactic and semantic analysis** of the Tiger language (a purely pedagogical programming language).
The lexer and parser for the compiler were written using Flex and Bison and the AST, binder and type-checker in C++.

Technologies: C++, Flex/Bison
