<h2 id="skills">SKILLS</h2>
<p><code class="highlighter-rouge">Throughout these past couple of years, I learned how to program in C and C++ and how to handle the trickier aspects of memory managements. I also learned how to program in Java with a couple of projects focused on multithreading and graphical interfaces. Finally, I know Python, with a focus on pandas, bokeh and networkx. And recenlty I've also extended my Python knowledge to Django.</code></p>

<p><strong>Bac+3</strong><br />
ESIB or École Supérieur des Ingénieurs de Beyrouth is an engineering school in Lebanon. I joined it in 2015 for my “classes préparatoires” which are mandatory pre-engineering classes in the french system that span over two years. I have also studied computer engineering in ESIB for a year before deciding to move to France and tranfer to EPITA.</p>

<p>During my internship at <a href="https://haute-couture.enioka.com/">enioka Haute Couture</a>, I worked on ComDaAn. ComDaAn previously used git repositories to produce visualization about the corresponding community’s activity, size, network and member centrality. My work consisted of adding mailing lists and GitLab issues as additional data sources and the option for an issue response analysis. I also worked on multiprocessing the time consuming operations and on integrating LOWESS regressions for the curves in the project._<br />
Technologies used: Python (pandas, networkx and bokeh)</p>
